## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- `submitPayments` (bulk) — new server-side function that processes all selected transactions in a single Apps Script call. Reads both sheets once, builds ID maps for O(1) lookups, validates each transaction, then writes all payment rows in a single batch `setValues` call. Uses `Utilities.getUuid()` for payment IDs to prevent same-second collisions during bulk writes. Wrapped in `LockService.getUserLock()` to prevent overlapping calls. Returns `{ success, saved, errors: [{ id, error }] }` so the client knows exactly what happened per transaction

### Fixed
- Bulk payment now reports failed transaction IDs explicitly in the toast (e.g. "Failed: TXN-20260310-143022") instead of a generic error count
- Dashboard budget figures now use `normalizeBudgetToRange` — consistent with the Reports page. Previously the dashboard used an annual average (bi-weekly × 26/12) which diverged from the actual days in the viewed window
- `updateTransaction` now fails loudly if any required column is missing rather than silently skipping writes
- `updateTransaction` now writes all four columns in a single `setValues` call instead of four separate `setValue` calls

### Removed
- `normalizeBudgetToMonthly` — fully replaced by `normalizeBudgetToRange` which is now used by both dashboard and reports
- Sequential `processNext` payment chain in frontend — replaced by single `submitPayments` call
- `finishPayments` frontend function — no longer needed

### Changed
- `submitPayments` frontend function simplified to a single `google.script.run` call
- Logging added to `updateTransaction`, `submitPayment`, and `submitPayments` for both success and error paths

---

## [1.2.3] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- Update checker incorrectly showed "update available" when local version was ahead of GitHub (e.g. running 1.2.2 against a repo still on 1.2.1). Version comparison now uses proper semantic version logic — update is only prompted when remote is strictly greater than local. Handles double-digit version components correctly (e.g. 1.10.0 > 1.9.0)
- Dashboard budget figures now scale to the exact days in the viewed window using `normalizeBudgetToRange`, consistent with the Reports page. Previously the dashboard used an annual average (e.g. bi-weekly × 26/12) which was always slightly off — March would show $1,300 instead of the correct $1,328.57. Pay Period mode now shows exactly the entered per-period amount, and Calendar Month shows the budget proportional to that month's actual day count

### Removed
- `normalizeBudgetToMonthly` — fully replaced by `normalizeBudgetToRange` which is now used by both the dashboard and reports. The old function produced averaged monthly figures that diverged from reality the more days a month had

### Changed
- `generatePayDays` — fixed duplicate `var d` and `var i` declarations across `if` branches; variables now declared once before the switch, which is correct under strict mode
- `getReportsData` — bills loading now uses `sheetToObjects` and named column access (`BillName`, `Amount`, `DayDue`) instead of raw range index access; makes the function resilient to column reordering
- `getReportsData` — bills load error is now logged via `Logger.log` instead of being silently swallowed
- `normalizeBudgetToMonthly` — added clarifying comment that this function is Dashboard-only; Reports uses `normalizeBudgetToRange` instead
- `shiftDate` — moved next to `toYMD` with the other date helpers rather than sitting after `getReportsData`
- `openEditSheet` — date field now populated from `t.date` (ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`) directly instead of parsing the display string `transactionDate`; eliminates a fragile manual split
- `clearTxnFilters` — removed unused `pfx` parameter and updated both call sites
- `renderTrend` — reformatted from dense minified one-liners to normal readable code
- `_savedScrollTop` — now saves `0` explicitly so navigating back to the top of a page correctly clears the saved position

### Removed
- `getSetupData` (Code.gs) — dead code; `getAppData` returns the same information and is what the frontend calls
- `makeBudgetRow` (Index.html) — dead code; superseded by `makeTypeRow` which has an editable name field
- Duplicate `// ── REPORTS` section comment in Index.html
- Stale development comment referencing bills array integration that was completed in an earlier session

---

## [1.2.2] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- Version mismatch detection — on load, `Index.html` compares its own `HTML_VERSION` against `scriptVersion` returned by `getAppData`. If they differ, a persistent red banner appears: "⚠️ Version mismatch — script vX.X.X / html vX.X.X. Please update both files and redeploy." Banner is hidden when versions match
- `HTML_VERSION` constant added to top of script block in `Index.html` — bumped alongside `APP_VERSION` in `Code.gs` on every release
- `scriptVersion` field added to `getAppData` response so the frontend can read the server-side version
- Version check result logged via the diagnostic log (`version:ok` or `version:mismatch`)

---

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- Budget vs Actual report always showed a monthly budget figure regardless of the selected date range — a bi-weekly $600 budget would show as $1,300 even when viewing a single pay period. Replaced `normalizeBudgetToMonthly` with `normalizeBudgetToRange` which converts to a daily rate and scales by the exact number of days in the selected range, so any preset (pay period, last month, last 30 days, custom) shows the correct proportional budget

### Changed
- `Install.gs` no longer declares `APP_VERSION` — version is now read from `Code.gs` via `getAppVersion()`. `Install.gs` does not need to be updated on future releases unless the installer itself changes
- Added `getAppVersion()` to `Code.gs` as the single source of truth for the app version
- Added `normalizeBudgetToRange(amount, frequency, startDate, endDate)` to `Code.gs` for proportional budget scaling across arbitrary date ranges

---

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- Reports page fully overhauled — replaced month picker with a date range filter bar supporting presets: This Pay Period, Last Pay Period, This Month, Last Month, Last 30 Days, and Custom date range
- Reports now show four panels: Budget vs Actual, By Card, Cash Flow, and Trend
- By Card panel — Chart.js donut chart plus a table showing charged, paid, and outstanding balance per card
- Cash Flow panel — table of pay periods within the selected date range showing bills due, card spending, and total outgoing per period
- Payables list sort controls — sort by Date ↓↑, Amount ↓↑, Card A–Z, Type A–Z on both mobile and desktop
- Payables list filter controls — compact single-row bar with expandable filter panel; filter by card, expense type, and date range; Filter button highlights when filters are active
- Desktop payables rows now show inline Edit and Delete buttons — no swipe required
- Pull-to-refresh on mobile Payables page — pull down from the top of the list to trigger a full data reload
- Refresh icon button on desktop Payables control bar — spins while loading
- Chart.js 4.4.1 loaded from cdnjs for donut chart rendering
- Logging added to `applyTxnControls` and `renderPayables` for sort/filter state tracing
- Server-side `Logger.log` added to `getUnpaidTransactionsInternal` confirming ISO date field on every call

### Fixed
- Bulk pay (mark all selected as paid) was only processing a subset of transactions — parallel `google.script.run` calls hit Apps Script's concurrency limit; replaced with sequential chained processing; button now shows live "Saving X of Y…" progress
- Sort by date had no effect — transactions in `appData.transactions` were missing the `date` (ISO) field; `getUnpaidTransactionsInternal` only returned `transactionDate` (display string); added `date` field via `parseSheetDate` → `toYMD`
- Date filter had no effect for the same reason as above
- Sort controls on desktop silently reset to `date-desc` after every change — both mobile and desktop selects exist in the DOM simultaneously; loop was letting the inactive select overwrite the active one; fixed by passing prefix explicitly from each `onchange` handler
- By Card report always showed $0.00 paid — `getReportsData` checked `t.paid` (field doesn't exist) and accumulated `t.amount` instead of `t.totalPaid`; fixed to use `t.totalPaid` unconditionally
- Stray dropdown arrows appearing beside sort/filter selects inside `.txn-controls` — caused by `.select-wrap::after` CSS triangle applying globally; suppressed inside `.txn-controls` and restored native browser appearance on those selects
- Refresh button was visible on mobile where pull-to-refresh already handles reload; hidden on mobile via body class CSS

### Changed
- `getReportsData` signature changed from `(year, month)` to `(startDate, endDate)` ISO date strings
- `getUnpaidTransactionsInternal` now returns a `date` field (ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`) alongside the existing `transactionDate` display string
- `loadAppData` now accepts an optional callback, used by `triggerRefresh` to stop the spinner on completion
- Report panels reorganized from 3 (BVA, Allocation, Trend) to 4 (BVA, By Card, Cash Flow, Trend); desktop shows all four in a 2×2 grid

- Setup UI switches from wizard to standard tab interface after first successful save
- Step indicators update immediately when navigating between wizard steps based on current form state
- Migration: existing configured users automatically receive the setupComplete flag on first load — no wizard shown

### Fixed
- Welcome overlay flash on initial page load — overlay now starts hidden and is shown only after data loads
- Multi-user transaction saving — documented and enforced `Execute as: Me` deployment requirement
- Step checkmarks were never visible because UI switched to tab mode before user could see them
- Separate Budgets tab removed — budget amounts now live alongside expense types
